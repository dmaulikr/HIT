# HIT

HIT, short for "Hang in There", is an iPhone app which allows someone to enter short motivational messages, aphorisms, or mantras. 

The app will randomly cycle through these mantras and periodically push notifications to the user. It is also able to show the user's mantras as complication's on an Apple Watch's face.

The app is designed to have a custom card-based user interface which is backed up UIKitDynamics animations and interruptable/interactive transitions.
